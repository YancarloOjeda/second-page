    <h3 class = "career">What's my career?</h3>
    <p>I'm a psychologist from the Autonomous University of Aguascalientes, and I have a Master degree in Science of Behavior from the University of Guadalajara. Currently I'm coursing an engineering in Software Development in the Open and Online University of Mexico (UnADM)</p>
    <h3>What are my interest areas?</h3>
    <p>As psychologist I have three areas of interest:
      <ul>
        <li>
          The <em><b> first </b></em> is the mathemathical and computational models of behavior.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em><b>second</b></em> is the mechanism that underlaying in learning, specifically in Pavlovian learning, here I use an experimental approach with laboratory rats.
        </li>
        <li>
          The <em><b>third </b></em>one is the area of Artificial Intelligence in general, but in specific artificial neuronal networks and robotics.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

  <p>As student of Software Development, I'm very interesting in areas like Big Data, Data Science, development of Data Base, and development of software applications for research.</p>
